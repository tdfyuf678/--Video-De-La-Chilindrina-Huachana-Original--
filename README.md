"All We Imagine as Light," directed by Payal Kapadia, is a poignant exploration of female friendship and urban life set against the backdrop of contemporary Mumbai. The film, which premiered at Cannes in 2024 and won the Grand Prix, centers on the lives of three women‚ÄîPrabha (Kani Kusruti), Anu (Divya Prabha), and Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam)‚Äîeach facing personal and societal challenges within a rapidly changing cityscape.

Prabha, a nurse, experiences a complex relationship with Dr. Manoj, navigating emotional conflicts tied to her estranged husband. Meanwhile, Anu, her roommate, is caught in a forbidden romance with Shiaz, a man of a different faith, reflecting the interfaith tensions within Indian society. The narrative is further enriched by Parvaty, an older woman being displaced from her home due to urban development, symbolizing the struggles of the marginalized amidst rampant gentrification.

The film‚Äôs visual storytelling, captured by cinematographer Ranabir Das, uses light as a metaphor for hope and resilience. Scenes depicting Mumbai's bustling skyline, intimate hospital settings, and coastal villages create a tapestry of contrasting worlds, emphasizing themes of impermanence and connection. Kapadia‚Äôs direction blends realism with elements of magical realism, particularly in the film's climactic sequences.

Critics praise Kapadia‚Äôs sensitive portrayal of female solidarity, urban alienation, and the quiet defiance of its protagonists against societal norms. The film resonates deeply, portraying not just the struggles but also the quiet moments of joy and resistance that define their lives.
